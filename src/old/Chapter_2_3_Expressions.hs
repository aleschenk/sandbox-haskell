module Chapter_2_3_Expressions where
--Everything in Haskell is an expression or declaration. Expressions
--may be values, combinations of values, and/or functions applied
--to values. Expressions evaluate to a result. In the case of a literal
--value, the evaluation is trivial as it only evaluates to itself. In the case
--of an arithmetic equation, the evaluation process is the process of
--computing the operator and its arguments, as you might expect. But,
--even though not all of your programs will be about doing arithmetic,
--all of Haskellâ€™s expressions work in a similar way, evaluating to a
--result in a predictable, transparent manner. Expressions are the
--building blocks of our programs, and programs themselves are one
--big expression made of smaller expressions.
